# Auto-Negotiator-for-Pakistani-E-Commerce-OLX-

An AI‑powered Auto Negotiator designed for Pakistani e‑commerce platforms (specifically OLX) that assists buyers and sellers by automatically negotiating prices based on predefined strategies, market logic, and user preferences.
This project demonstrates how conversational AI and rule‑based intelligence can be combined to automate real‑world negotiation scenarios commonly seen in online marketplaces in Pakistan.

- Features

 Automated price negotiation logic
 Tailored for Pakistani e‑commerce culture (OLX‑style bargaining)
 Customizable negotiation thresholds (min/max price)
 Strategy‑based counter‑offers
 Decision logic based on offer gaps
 Implemented in Jupyter Notebook for easy experimentation

- Tech Stack

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy / Pandas (if used for logic & calculations)
Rule‑based AI logic

- How It Works

User sets a target price range
System receives an initial offer

- Negotiation logic evaluates:

Price difference
Acceptable margin
Counter‑offer strategy

- System responds with:

 Accept
 Counter Offer
 Reject
